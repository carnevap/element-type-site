          	The <b>Fire type</b> is one of the <i>eighteen</i> Pokémon Types.
			It is notable for being one of the three Starter types, forming a perfectly triangular relationship with Grass and Water.
			Fire-type moves are based on attacks of fire itself, and most of them can leave the status Burn. Fire types are also immune to being Burned, regardless of the type of move used that would have inflicted a Burn.
            Fire Pokémon have notably fewer species compared to the other Starter types, due to a lack of natural phenomena that can be described as fire - the Slugma line, Numel line, Magmar line, Torkoal, and Volcanion are 
            the closest representation. Some Fire-type species are based on land animals known for their predatory instincts, such as Pyroar, Arcanine and Heatmor. The Vulpix and Fennekin lines are both based on Japanese 
            folklore linking species of fox with fire, while curiously, most generations of Fire-type starter, as well as the Ponyta, Houndour and Pansear lines, are all based on animals from the Chinese zodiac. However, 
            there are a few Fire-type Pokémon that are based on inanimate objects, such as Rotom's Heat form and the Litwick line.
