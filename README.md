Hello and welcome to the exciting world of Pokémon! This website serves as an introduction to what Pokémon is, more specifically, what kind of types of Pokémon exist. There are many different types of Pokémon but today we will only look at the basic nine types. The basic nine types of Pokémon include fire type Pokémon, water type Pokémon, electric type Pokémon, grass type Pokémon, ground type Pokémon, poison type Pokémon, psychic type Pokémo, fighting type Pokémon and flying type Pokémon. Each one of these types has different ups and downsides. Think of rock-paper-scissors. Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beat paper. It's the same here: fire beats grass, grass beats water, water beats fire. You can use the type icons below to navigate to the different types of Pokémon!
