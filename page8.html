            The <b>Fighting type</b> is one of the <i>eighteen</i> Pokémon elemental types. Pokémon of this type are specialists in melee attacks, such as punches and kicks. It could be 
            said that they're the opposite to Psychic-type Pokémon because while Pokémon of that type depend primarily on special attacks, Pokémon of the Fighting type depend 
            mostly on physical attacks. In particular, every Fighting-type attack introduced before Generation IV remained a physical attack, with special Fighting attacks 
            only being introduced from Generation IV onwards. Most Fighting-type Pokémon have a human-like body shape because they represent practitioners of various martial 
            arts, which tend to be real-world humans. Some Fighting-type Pokémon are represented by looking like fighters (Machamp looks like a bodybuilder and Crabrawler 
            looks like a French-wrestler) while other are represented by being based on a certain type of fighting style (Hitmontop is based on capoeira fighting and Gallade 
            is based on sword-fighting). A considerable number of Fighting-type Pokémon are predominantly or exclusively male. They can also be represented by simply just 
            having incredible strength (such Pokémon such as Bewear, Pangoro, Crabominable, Conkeldurr and others have this).
