        	The <b>Poison type</b> is one of the <i>eighteen</i> Pokémon elemental types. These Pokémon have a natural toxic quality; some directly represent real-world 
            species known for their venom, such as snakes, and some even represent pollution itself. They normally live in caves, marshes or similar places. Most Poison-type Pokémon 
            are based on poisonous or venomous animals (Pokémon such as Seviper, which is a snake, Drapion, which is a scorpion, and Scolipede, which is a centipede). Some of them 
            are also based on poisonous plants or fungi (Pokémon such as Foongus, which is a mushroom, and Oddish, which is a mandrake root). Most dual Poison-type Pokémon have Bug 
            type or Grass type as their other type. This reflects how, in real life, many insects and plants are poisonous or venomous. A very curious fact about Poison-type Pokémon 
            is that some of them resemble ninjas. For example, Koffing is like a smoke ball, Crobat has a ninja's speed and secrecy and Toxicroak has paws that make it resemble a 
            ninja. Some Poison types also resemble types of pollution. For instance, Garbodor represents trash pollution, Weezing represents air pollution and Muk represents liquid 
            pollution. Strangely, not all Poison types are based on poisonous or venomous things (Stunky, which is based on a skunk, and Skrelp, which is based on a leafy sea dragon, 
            are both real-life animals that are not poisonous or venomous).
